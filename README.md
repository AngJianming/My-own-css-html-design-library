# My-own-developer-design-template-libraries

This is meant to be a storage where I compile different types of design ranging from buttons, taskbars, navigation bars, animated backgrounds, futuristic gradiant coloring and other minor personal designs I made using **HTML5** & **CSS3** and maybe some **React** & **Next.js** as well.

Do keep in mind there will be no functionalities as this repo will only be based of Frontend Designs, Animation & Effects.

## How To Use?
By changing the different brances scroll down features at the top left side of the repository, by default should show `main v`.
